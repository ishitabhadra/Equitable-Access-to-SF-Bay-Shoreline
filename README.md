# Equitable-Access-to-SF-Bay-Shoreline

This project analyzes whether shoreline access across the Bay Area is equitably distributed across race and income groups.

Using access point service areas (walk, bike, drive) and demographic data from the ACS and BCDC Community Vulnerability dataset, the repository includes exploratory analysis and visualizations built in R and Python.
